13. COMBINATION, FORGING AND REFORGING
==============================================

The workshop ability to reforge equipment is possibly the finest option 
available to the core player. This is where you'll really get the chance to 
establish your daylight-shunning gamer status, spending hours in a to-and-fro 
motion betwixt storage container and the Equipment Set-up option. Because this 
guide is eager for you all to get those diurnally-necessary skin vitamins, 
however, we're establishing this section for quick and easy referencing of both 
techniques and component lists to so that you can check for the best 
combinations on a handy table. The original lists are mine by research, and it 
is merely a matter of time before I write up my remaining notes, but I'm also 
hoping to credit many of you with unforeseen addenda.

There are several reasons for choosing the COMBINE option:

(a) Improving an item's metal
There are seven different materials at work in Vagrant Story; Wood, Leather, 
Bronze, Iron, Hagane, Silver and Damascus.  This order also represents the 
increasing strength and resilience of the metals involved, with some additional 
factors thrown in. Through use of the workshop, it's possible to combine various 
materials to create either stronger items or items constructed of completely new 
materials.

The general rule is that lesser materials become absorbed into greater ones. So 
if you combine a Hagane shield with an Iron shield, the result will be Hagane 
rather than Iron. Rare materials are more difficult to combine, and be warned 
that you may even end up with a shield that is less powerful as a result (see 
point 3 below). There are some interesting metallurgical results derived from 
combination, though, as follows:

(i) Combining Bronze and Iron creates Hagane.
This is a useful trick to use early in the game, as you can take your starting 
items and improve their strength while retaining all the bonuses you've 
accumulated. So that much-loved Fandango blade needn't be tossed aside: find an 
Iron Scimitar blade, combine it with the Bronze Fandango, then reassemble the 
blade with the best grip you can find for a brand new Hagane weapon. 

(ii) Sometimes, combining Bronze and Hagane items results in a Silver item. 
I've yet to suss the exact conditions for this, and would like to hear how it's 
resolved. But I can say that if you're looking at an unwanted Silver result from 
a combination, try alternating the order of the items being combined. I've 
noticed that the Silver result normally occurs when you have a Bronze item in 
the first field and a Hagane item in the second. Reversing them so that the 
Hagane item is listed first can actually change the result to Hagane rather than 
Silver.

(iii) Sometimes, combining Hagane and Silver items results in a Damascus item. 
A couple of contributors and myself are on the brink of sussing the rules for 
this, but Silver and Damascus aren't pure or unmixable at all. You will be able 
to upgrade all of that Hagane equipment to Damascus, in time, and it is possible 
to combine the two and retain a Damascus result.

(b) Creating a new item
Here's where you'll really get into the whole combination business through 
addiction. The game will only surrender so many weapons and pieces of armour: 
the rest are to be discovered, and most of those will only come into being if 
you make them yourself. In other words, there's a stack of great kit in the game 
that will only come into your possession if you use the workshop to make it by 
hand. Excited, yet? (As Vincent Merken puts it, &quot;Gotta forge 'em all!&quot;).

There are some perceivable rules to combination that will take your experiments 
beyond mere trial and error.

(i) Upgrading items from the same weapon group.
If you're looking to improve your weapons, the key is to stick with items of the 
same class. Some commonsense applies: if you combine a high-STR dagger with a 
low-STR dagger, you'll usually end up with a dagger whose STR rests somewhere in 
between.

Advancement through combination is also possible, and there are a couple of 
tricks to try out here when you're looking for the next big thing.

(ii) adding closely-related items.
Especially, this is the trick to use when you wish to bring your familiar 
starting items up to scratch. Combine a Jambeau leg-armour with the weaker 
Poleyn and you'll create the superior Missaglia. Then combine the Missaglia with 
another Poleyn and you'll have a Plate Legging. Keeping to the same class of 
weapon is important here, so if you want to upgrade item x in the list of Great 
Swords, try combining it with Great Sword x minus 1 (the next Great Sword down) 
or x minus 2.

(iii) combining identical items
If you've reached what seems like the end of the line with the previous 
technique, try doubling up for a result. For example, a Tilt Glove plus a Tilt 
Glove results in a Freiturnier; a Mjolnir plus a Mjolnir creates a Griever; a 
Hoplite Shield plus a Hoplite Shield will give a Jazeraint Shield; and so on.

(iv) creating new items from mixed groups
When you combine weapons from different groups, the results are less 
predictable. A mace combined with a polearm might actually lead to a rapier, or 
a crossbow. Mix legging armour with sleeve armour and you may find yourself 
looking at a type of helmet. This is one good reason for never discarding 
anything, in case it can be combined to create more than it seems. The rule here 
is that the sophistication of the items will come into play, and items from 
crossed classes will never be in the same league as those from which they're 
produced: combine a basic knife with a basic axe and the results will be basic, 
whereas a high-calibre dagger combined with a high-calibre axe might result in a 
new, mid-calibre class of weapon.

Furthermore, there seems to be a pegging system for the power of weapons and 
armour that you can exploit to create a new item in a different class but of the 
same relative strength. Try combining a glove with an armour, for instance, and 
if both are (say) at Fluted level then the result will stay Fluted too. See the 
table of suit groups below to find out how to make similarly pegged items.


(c) Strengthening a weapon
Even when you've created exactly the item you want, in the metal you want, the 
possibilities of combination remain. 

By way of example, let's take a piece of hand armour. Perhaps you've already 
combined a Vambrace (I) and a Gauntlet (B) to make your own Plate Glove (H) 
that's been serving you very well. Suddenly, you win a Plate Glove (I) that 
ought to be less powerful, but when you consult its basic stats you realise that 
it's almost as sound as the one you've made in Hagane and improved through a few 
hits. The good news is that there's no either/or here: what you can do is head 
to the workshop and combine the Iron Plate Glove with your Hagane model, 
resulting in a new Hagane Plate Glove that has some of the Iron's bonuses added 
to it.

This system works both ways, of course, and you may find that adding a negative 
statistic in the combination process has reduced some of your blade type or 
elemental modifiers. Sometimes the pluses are overwhelmed by the minuses and 
would result in an inferior piece of kit, so there's still a lot of status-
checking and weighing-up of odds to consider before you combine items.

In practical terms, this means you should use the SQUARE button to check the 
various statistics of the components you're combining with the result before 
acknowledging the combination. Keep pressing SQUARE to cycle through all 
attribute displays, incidentally.

(d) Strengthening armour
The most important aspect here is the Type rating. A piece of armour can gain 
all sorts of creature-class and elemental bonuses, but the Type rating remains 
fixed. When combining, look for combinations that improve the Type rating and 
avoid those that reduce it. The ideal combination will give your item a decent 
stat in all three classes.

The next factors to watch for are those negative affinity modifiers. If you 
start adding lots of negative values, you're building weaknesses into the 
armour. A helm with -20 vs Dark can be improved against Dark attacks over time, 
but working off that handicap will inevitably result in a near-similar number 
being subtracted from your vs Light score.

The technique is further limited by the possibility of accidental upgrade. 
Combine a Tilt Glove with a Tilt Glove and you'll actually get a Freiturner, 
when you may have wished to retain a Tilt Glove for future combination.

The long and short of it, though, is that you should never discard less 
sophisticated items that might be combined with your existing equipment for 
potential gain. No matter how simple its design, a Bronze Buckler made of a 
thousand used and scavenged shields may offer more protection than a fresh 
Damascus Targe that's never seen combat.

14. COMBINATION TABLES
==============================================

My notes are still being written up for weapons, but this should set you on the 
road to invulnerability. Note that there seem to be some 'key' items that you 
can't make from lesser items in the same group, and that aren't available to you 
until you reach certain areas. I suppose this is one way of moderating player 
defence, and also preventing somebody putting together a suit of Fluted Mail 
from piles of Leather Bear Masks and Bandages...

To upgrade your starting items, at first you may need to add them to much more 
powerful items of the same kind just to put them on the step of gradual 
advancement, as outlined in these tables. For instance, combining the Tovarisch 
Hand Axe with a Battle Axe will get you nowhere, but incorporate it into a 
Francisca and you're on the upgrade tree.

A quick note on end results. There isn't much difference between the Dread class 
and the Jazeraint class, when it comes down to it, as it's more a question of a 
single point that goes either towards STR at the expense of INT (Dread) or 
towards INT at the expense of STR(Jazeraint). A personal choice, in other words. 
Though why anybody would want that ugly great Dread Shield when you could have a 
lovely red Jazeraint diamond with a Rood on it...

Also, if you acquire the Holy Wind rood blade or the Hand of Light maces, note 
that these work like metal converters and possess some unusual combination 
properties. Place the rood blade in the first slot of Combine / Blades and, as 
long as the weapon you add to it is sufficiently powerful, you'll produce that 
second weapon in Damascus while retaining its design.

The Hand of Light is also a metal converter: place it in the second slot of 
Combine / Blades, stick any other item in the first slot and you'll produce that 
first item in the same metal as the Hand of Light (Iron or Hagane). In reverse, 
some alternative combinations are possible. The two tricks don't work together 
to make a Damascus Hand of Light, however.

SUIT GROUPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 16 distinct 'suits of armour' in the game, many of them roughly 
corresponding to historical fashions (for instance, the angular 'poleyn' 
kneepads and plate segments over mail both appeared in the early- to mid-14th 
Century). If you combine items from the same suit group, you'll create another 
item within that group. For example, add an Armet to a Brigandine -- both group 
11 -- and you'll get the Missaglia. This is how the items match up for each 
group:

No| SLEEVE ARMOUR    HELM            BODY ARMOUR      LEG ARMOUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1| Bandage          Bandana         Jerkin           Sandals

 6| Chain Sleeve     Spangenhelm     Ring Mail        Ring Leggings
 7| Gauntlet         Cabasset        Chain Mail       Chain Leggings
 8| Vambrace         Sallet          Breastplate      Fusskampf
 9| Plate Glove      Barbut          Segmentata       Poleyn
10| Rondanche        Basinet         Scale Armor      Jambeau
11| Tilt Glove       Armet           Brigandine       Missaglia
12| Freiturnier      Close Helm      Plate Mail       Plate Leggings
13| Fluted Glove     Burgonet        Fluted Armor     Fluted Leggings
14| Hoplite Glove    Hoplite Helm    Hoplite Armor    Hoplite Leg's
15| Jazeraint Glove  Jazeraint Helm  Jazeraint Armor  Jazeraint Leg's
16| Dread Glove      Dread Helm      Dread Armor      Dread Leggings

NB The game's sixteen shields also correspond to these groups - so that Knight 
Shield (no. 13) would properly be worn with Fluted Armour, aesthetically 
speaking - but as there's no workshop crossover, and you can't actually see the 
armour, it doesn't really mean very much and there are no perceptible bonuses 
for wearing a 'complete' suit.
